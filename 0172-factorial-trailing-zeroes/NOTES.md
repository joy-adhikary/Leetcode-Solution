I know that a number gets a zero at the end of it if the number has 10 as a factor. For instance, 10 is a factor of 50, 120, and 1234567890; but 10 is only once a factor of each of these numbers, which is why each number has only one trailing zero. So I need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the expansion of 23!.

I note that 5×2 = 10, so I need to account for all the products of 5 and 2 that exist in a given factorial's expansion. Looking at the factors in the above expansion, there are many more numbers that are multiples of 2 (namely, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, …) than are multiples of 5 (namely, 5, 10, 15, …).
​
No matter how many times that 5 is a factor of a given expansion, I know that 2 will be a factor many times more often. If I take all the numbers in the expansion that have 5 as a factor, I'll have way more than enough even numbers to pair with the factor-5 numbers to get factors of 10 — and another trailing zero on my factorial.
​
So to find the number of times 10 is a factor, all I really need to worry about is how many times 5 is a factor in all of the numbers between 1 and 23. I can ignore the factors of 2.
