// way 1        time - O(n) space - O(n/2) ==> O( n )
just simpily use map and return those element whose value is grater than n/2
// way 2    time - O(nlogn) space - O(1)
​
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. so if i sort the whole array then the majority element will be in the mid  point as it appears more then n/2+1
